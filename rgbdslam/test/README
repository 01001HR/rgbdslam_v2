Disclaimer: 
These scripts are meant for the evaluation of my own
research. They are publicized in the hope that they may be useful,
and while I would expect you to be able to reproduce the published
results, there is no guarantee that this will actually work, as 
the code is actively worked on and new stuff may break old things.


To test rgbdslam download one or more bagfiles from the rgbd benchmark:
http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download
and their according ground truth files into this directory.

Then run
./run_tests.sh [TEST_NAME]
This runs rgbdslam on the downloaded bag file(s) with the set of parameters
specified in test_settings.launch plus some specified in run_tests.sh itself.
In its original states, a comparison between different number of 
frame-to-frame matches will be performed.

The results will be put in the directory [TEST_NAME].
If you omit the optional [TEST_NAME] the date will be chosen.


The results will be displayed to the console. As an example, running the tests
on the "desk" bagfiles would lead to output similar to the following:

rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_desk ... rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_desk2 ... rgbd_dataset_freiburg2_desk ...
